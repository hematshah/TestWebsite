  <h3>Books and Teaching</h3>

  <p>These are the following books that I have read.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Stephen R.Covey. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_7_Habits_of_Highly_Effective_People">
        The 7 Habits of highly effective people</a> first published in 1989.

      <ul>
        <li>Stephen R. Covey's book, The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People,
          has been a top seller for the simple reason that it ignores trends
          and pop psychology for proven principles of fairness, integrity,
          honesty, and human dignity. Celebrating its 15th year of helping
          people solve personal and professional problems, this special
          anniversary edition includes a new foreword and afterword written
          by Covey that explore whether the 7 Habits are still relevant
          and answer some of the most common questions he has received over
          the past 15 years.
